# Deep-Learning project to classify plant leaves
*This project proposes a method known as anomaly detection using autoencoders using a set of collection of leaves. In this method an autoencoder model is built using keras and then the reconstruction of the original images of the leaves is done and the threshold loss is found in order to classify the plant leaves as healthy or diseased![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43497662/137612214-1f632139-1913-4d72-88c3-f775c63e497c.png)*
